# Deciphering-the-Genetic-Foundations-of-Diseases
About: This project is dedicated to unraveling the intricate connections between genes and diseases using network analysis, leveraging the "Diseasome" dataset. Through mapping the intricate web of relationships among genetic disorders and disease genes, we delve into disease comorbidity patterns and pinpoint promising therapeutic targets.
